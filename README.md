I’ve successfully completed Task 1 of my Front-End Development Internship at Codveda Technology — building a fully responsive landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

Here’s what I built:

✅ Responsive Landing Page – Includes a navigation bar, hero section, features area, and footer
✅ Mobile-First Design – Seamlessly adapts across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
✅ Semantic HTML – For better accessibility and SEO
✅ CSS Flexbox & Media Queries – Clean, modern, and scalable layout
✅ Smooth Scrolling & Animations – Enhanced user experience with interactive touches

This was a great hands-on project to strengthen my core front-end skills and practice writing clean, responsive code from scratch.

Grateful for the learning opportunity with @Codveda — excited for the next task!
